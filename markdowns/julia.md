# Julia Sets

Julia Sets also offer great fractals. The definition of the Julia sets is very similar to the mandelbrot set. As a reminder, the Mandelbrot set is the set of the complex numbers $`c`$ for which the sequence $`z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c`$ is bounded ($`z_0`$ is set to $`0`$). While, the definition of the Julia sets is the numbers $`z_0`$ for which the sequence is bounded, with $`c`$ a constant value.
